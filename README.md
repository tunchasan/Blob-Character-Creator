# Blob Character Creator

**Blob Character Creator** is a tool that provides functionality to create, customize and animate ```blob-like characters```. **Blob Shader** is used to achieving a blob-like appearance. The shader has created using a ```raymarching technique``` that uses complex calculations for rendering. The tool currently supports ```IOS```, ```Android```, ```macOS```, and ```Windows``` platforms.

## Future
With the following versions, I'm planning to add some cool features such like
#### ðŸ‘‰ The transition between any Blob Character to any.
> Transform appearance to target character via cool animations
#### ðŸ‘‰ Support Non-Humanoid Characters
#### ðŸ‘‰ Blob Character Customization Editor

## Shader Usages
There are two types of the Shader, ```Mobile``` and ```Standard```. Mobile is lighter than the standard blob shader. Thus, the Mobile shader has less functionality such as limitations for changing blob characters' every body part colors. I recommend that use the **BlobCharacter/Mobile** shader to get a good result **on mobile platforms.**

## Animating Blob Characters
The **Blob Shader** executes its rendering calculations based on referenced **Transform information**. So, It's possible to animate Blob Characters.
