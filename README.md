# Blob Character Creator

**Blob Character Creator** is a tool that provides functionality to create, customize and animate ```blob-like characters```. **Blob Shader** is used to achieving a blob-like appearance. The shader has created using a ```raymarching technique``` that uses complex calculations for rendering. The tool currently supports ```IOS```, ```Android```, ```macOS```, and ```Windows``` platforms.
